# Debugging GitHub Pages 404

If your workflow completed successfully but you still see a 404, check these:

## 1. Check Deployment Logs

In the Actions tab, click on the latest workflow run, then click on the **deploy-github-pages** job. Look for:

- **"Upload artifact"** step - Does it show files being uploaded?
- **"Deploy to GitHub Pages"** step - Does it show a deployment URL?
- Any error messages?

## 2. Verify Build Output

The build should create:
- `Pipeline/build/index.html` - Homepage
- `Pipeline/build/blog/` - Blog post pages
- `Pipeline/build/Images/` - Image assets

## 3. Check Pages Settings

Go to **Settings** → **Pages**:
- Should show "Your site is live at..." with a URL
- Should show the latest deployment
- Check the deployment status

## 4. Common Issues

### Issue: Artifact Path Wrong
**Symptom**: Deployment succeeds but 404
**Check**: Look at "Upload artifact" step logs - does it show files?
**Fix**: The path might need adjustment (see workflow)

### Issue: No index.html
**Symptom**: Build completes but no homepage
**Check**: Look at build logs - did Astro build successfully?
**Fix**: Check Astro build output

### Issue: Deployment Delay
**Symptom**: Everything green but site not live
**Solution**: Wait 2-5 minutes, GitHub Pages can take time to propagate

## 5. Manual Verification

In the workflow logs, the "Verify build output" step will show:
- What files are in the build
- Where index.html is located
- The directory structure

This will help identify if the path is correct.
